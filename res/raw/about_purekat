PureKat was assembled as a result of a developer that would not donate their invaluable knowledge when called upon for help. We decided to create our team so that we could work together and surpass any challenge that we were presented with in the whole scheme of development by calling on each other and our network of friends/colleagues. We’ve only added to our members as we've found people who believe the same way we do. 

Our goal is to provide the fastest ROM, with an simple and beautiful UI. Unlike other “CM” ROMs, we remained committed to keeping an ROM with the the best features and at the same time stable & smooth, perfect for daily usage. Our wish is to bring you the experience you want, at the customization level that is comfortable to you. Feel free to browse our code, fork our repos, change our code(and witty comments), build our ROM yourself at home, or contribute to our ROM by contacting us.
